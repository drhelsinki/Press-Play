WARNING---------

If you leave you laptop speaker unmuted, feedback will occur and this can be very loud.
I advise turning them off, but you can get some nice effects with the feedback if used carefully.


WHAT IT IS--------

Play music into your laptop microphone and watch the visuals adapt to the volume level. 

the outer most circles react to the behaviour of the inner circles, and the inner circles react
to the main center circle. Colour, size and motion are all decided depending on the volume
level that the center circle is reacting to. 

If you left mouse click in the center of the screen, it will reset the visuals to black.
